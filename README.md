# Insertion Sort Algorithm

## Introduction
Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient **comparison-based sorting algorithm**. It works similarly to how we sort playing cards in our hands. The algorithm builds the sorted list one element at a time by **inserting** each element into its correct position.

---

## Algorithm Steps
1. Assume the first element is already sorted.
2. Pick the next element and compare it with elements in the sorted part.
3. Shift elements to the right until the correct position for the current element is found.
4. Insert the element at its correct position.
5. Repeat for all elements.

## Pseudocode
```plaintext
InsertionSort(A, n)
1. for i = 1 to n-1
2.     key = A[i]
3.     j = i - 1
4.     while j >= 0 and A[j] > key
5.         A[j + 1] = A[j]
6.         j = j - 1
7.     A[j + 1] = key

```

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[5, 3, 8, 6, 2] --> B[3, 5, 8, 6, 2];
    B --> C[3, 5, 8, 6, 2];
    C --> D[3, 5, 6, 8, 2];
    D --> E[2, 3, 5, 6, 8];
